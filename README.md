The attached notebook will go over the final submission for the Kaggle competition that allowed me to reach the top score of 12% at the time of submission.

# A quick overview of what the notebook has included:

1. Reading the data
2. Data Visualization 
3. Data Cleaning
4. Feature Engineering
5. Splitting the data
6. Making predictions

# What I found important to have in this project:
 1. Feature engineering.
 2. Using XGBoost instead of Random Forest.
 3. The parameters used in the XGBoost Regression are important to take note of.
