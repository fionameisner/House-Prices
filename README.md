House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques


The attached notebook will go over the final submission for the Kaggle competition that allowed me to reach the top score of 12%.

A quick overview of what the notebook has included:

1. Reading the data
2. Data Visualization 
3. Data Cleaning
4. Feature Engineering
5. Splitting the data
6. Making predictions

What I found important to have in this project was the feature engineering and also using XGBoost instead of Random Forest.
